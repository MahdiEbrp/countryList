# Hello World!
Here is a list of countries with their capitals, geographical locations, currency symbols, and first day of the week.
The names of the capitals were obtained from [icyrockcom](https://github.com/icyrockcom)/**[country-capitals](https://github.com/icyrockcom/country-capitals)**
Geolocation data was provided by the [opendatasoft.org](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/geonames-all-cities-with-a-population-1000/table/?disjunctive.cou_name_en&sort=name) API.
The remaining data was collected with the help of C# functions (RegionInfo and CultureInfo).
